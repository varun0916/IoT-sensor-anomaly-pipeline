# 📡 IoT Sensor Anomaly Detection Pipeline

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **IoT Sensor Anomaly Detection Pipeline** is an end-to-end Data Engineering project designed to process real-time IoT sensor data, detect anomalies, and generate actionable insights for monitoring and predictive maintenance.

The pipeline follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** using the **Databricks Lakehouse platform**. Data is ingested from AWS services, processed using PySpark, stored in Delta Lake tables, and used for dashboards and alerting systems.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- IOT devices generate large volumes of sensor data continuously, requiring efficient real-time processing and monitoring.
  
- Without automated systems, detecting abnormal sensor behavior is difficult, leading to device failures, downtime, and operational losses.
  
- This project builds a scalable data pipeline to enable real-time anomaly detection and proactive monitoring of IoT systems.
  
- The main objectives of this project are:
  
  Build a real-time streaming data pipeline using Amazon Kinesis.
  
     - Implement Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) in Databricks. 

     - Clean and transform raw IoT sensor data.

     - Apply anomaly detection techniques using Z-score.

     - Provide real-time dashboards for monitoring sensor health. 

     - Trigger Slack alerts for critical anomalies.

     - This enables proactive monitoring and predictive maintenance.

##Data Build Tools(DBT)

- Integrated dbt in the Gold layer to perform advanced transformations on IoT sensor data.
  
- Used existing fact and dimension tables (fact_device_monitoring, dim_sensor, dim_location, dim_time) as input sources.
  
- Built dbt models to generate insights like device health analysis, anomaly detection, downtime analysis, and critical device monitoring.
  
- Created modular SQL models to improve scalability, reusability, and maintainability of the pipeline.
  
- Applied data quality tests (like not null, unique) using dbt to ensure accurate and reliable data.
  
- Materialized dbt models as tables in Databricks Delta Lake, which are used for dashboards and monitoring.
